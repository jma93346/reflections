What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When I initialize a repository, it creates a .git subdirectory which contains what is necessary for the repo. I need to do it to be able to utilize  git and version control. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It's different because it is just commits that are about to be saved. It allows you to make sure that you have everything you need before you commit.
