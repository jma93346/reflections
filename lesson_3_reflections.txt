When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want to use a remote repository when I am working with other people or want to make my repository public

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Sometimes the remote repository could make some conflicts with your local repo.
