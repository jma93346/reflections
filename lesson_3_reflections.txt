When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want to use a remote repository when I am working with other people or want to make my repository public

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Sometimes the remote repository could make some conflicts with your local repo. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are when you want to borrow someone else's repository and having their original still be there.
Clones are for when you want to make a copy of anothe repo to be able to pull/push when needed.
Branches are made to keep in track certain changes/features before merging the branches when ready.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It makes it so you can make changes in your local repo and compare changes with remote repo to help merge branches.
